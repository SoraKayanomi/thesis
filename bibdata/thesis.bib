abstract="We investigate the Einstein relation $\sigma$ = $\beta$D between the diffusion constant D and the ``mobility'', of a ``test particle'' interacting with its environment: $\beta$−1 is the temperature of the system where D is measured and $\sigma$E is the drift in a constant external field E. The relation is found to be satisfied for all model systems in which we can find a unique stationary non-equilibrium State of the environment, as seen from the test particle in the presence of the field. For some systems, e.g. infinite systems of hard rods in one dimension, we find non unique stationary states which do not satisfy the Einstein relation. For some models in a periodic box the Einstein relation is the most direct way of obtaining D . A precise macroscopic formulation of the Einstein relation which makes it mathematically very plausible is given.",

abstract="We provide a brief introduction to applications of ordinary differential equation (ODE) rate equations in chemistry, biology and physics. In mechanics, Newton's laws prescribe how to write the rate equations while in other fields, the ODEs are based on different principles. In the context of chemical reactions, the law of mass action yields systems of first-order ODEs in terms of the reactants and products. For population dynamics and epidemic models, similar considerations yield comparable nonlinear ODEs. We review geometric and analytic considerations based on local properties for single first-order autonomous equations (phase line dynamics) and extend them to the qualitative understanding of global behaviour in two-dimensional phase plane systems.",

However, useful work cannot be extracted from the existing in vitro systems because filament motions are in random directions on two-dimensional surfaces. We succeeded in restricting kinesin-driven movements of microtubules along linear tracks by using micrometer-scaled grooves lithographically fabricated on glass surfaces. We also accomplished the extraction of unidirectional movement from the bidirectional movements along the linear tracks by adding arrowhead patterns on the tracks. These “rectifiers” enabled us to construct microminiturized circulators in which populations of microtubules rotated in one direction, and to actively transport microtubules between two pools connected by arrowheaded tracks in the fields of micrometer scales."

abstract="``Electrode potential'' is certainly the most used term in electrochemistry, and is very likely to be one of the most popular in the entire field of chemistry. Sound knowledge of the physical and chemical phenomena involved in the establishment of electrode potentials does not correspond, however, to the very wide use of the term. None would be surprised by a 0.059-V change in potential of a hydrogen electrode as the activity of H+ in solution is changed by a power of ten, but it would certainly be surprising if everyone knowing this were actually able to give a physical description of what is occurring at the electrode as the concentration of H+ is changed and why the electrode potential changes. Further, when the term ``electrode potential'' is used, it generally refers to the potential as experimentally measured with respect to a given reference electrode. Conceptually, however, no reference electrode must necessarily be involved for an ``electrode potential'' to be defined. It follows that the physical meaning behind the same term ``electrode potential'' is quite different in the two cases. This is certainly not as well recognized as the term itself is.",

abstract = {The formation rate, crystal phase, and primary and secondary particle sizes of hydrous zirconia particles produced under the hydrolysis conditions of various ZrOCl2concentrations (0.1–0.4 mol/dm3) and reaction temperatures (343–373 K) were measured to investigate the effects of ZrOCl2concentration and reaction temperature on the formation process. Chemical analyses and X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that hydrous zirconia particles synthesized under all of the hydrolysis conditions were similar to those observed in monoclinic crystalline zirconia, except that the crystal structure changed as the chlorine content increased under the synthesizing conditions of 0.4 mol/dm3 and ≤363 K. The primary particle size of monoclinic hydrous zirconia particles decreased as the ZrOCl2concentration increased and was independent of the reaction temperature. The secondary particle size of hydrous zirconia particles synthesized at ZrOCl2concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mol/dm3 increased monotonously, first increased and then decreased, and decreased monotonously as the reaction temperature decreased, respectively. The rate constants (k) of the hydrous zirconia particles were determined experimentally by applying Avrami–Erofeev's equation. The determined k value decreased as the ZrOCl2concentration increased and the reaction temperature decreased. From Arrhenius plots of k, the activation energies for hydrous zirconia particles in the monoclinic phase and containing high chlorine contents were determined to be 387–396 and 249 kJ/mol, respectively. The nucleation and crystal-growth mechanisms of primary particles and the formation mechanism of secondary particles formed by hard aggregations among primary particles were determined based on the present experimental results.},

abstract  ="We present a critical discussion of how chemistry textbooks treat the electrolysis of water and aqueous salt solutions{,} based on a survey of general chemistry textbooks in English and Korean at secondary and tertiary levels{,} also informed by the historical background of 19th-century debates. English-language textbooks present various and contradictory accounts of the electrolysis of water; a key point of disagreement is whether hydrogen and oxygen gases originate from pre-existing H+ and OH− ions{,} or from the direct reduction and oxidation of H2O molecules. School textbooks in South Korea all present the same account{,} with no indication of alternative views. A vast majority of all texts ignore the possibility that H2 and O2 may result from secondary reactions{,} which was a standard view in the late 19th century following the works of Daniell and Miller. Concerning the electrolysis of aqueous salt solutions{,} all texts give oversimplified views of competing reactions based on standard reduction/oxidation potentials. It is understandable that textbooks try to present sufficiently simple pictures that students at each level can handle; however{,} this should not be done in a way that shuts down questions. We recommend that students should be made aware that textbook accounts are only models{,} and encouraged to extend their learning beyond the models. The plausibility of our recommendations is shown in a pilot study we conducted with secondary school students in South Korea."

abstract={Many cell types communicate by means of dendritic extensions via a multi-tiered set of geometric and chemical cues. Until recently, mimicking the compartmentalized in vivo cellular environment of dendrite-expressing cells such as osteocytes and motor neurons in a spatially and temporally controllable manner was limited by the challenges of in vitro device fabrication at submicron scales. Utilizing the improved resolution of current fabrication technology, we have designed a multiscale device, the Macro-micro-nano system, or M$\mu$n, composed of two distinct cell-seeding and interrogation compartments separated by a nanochannel array. The array enables dendrite ingrowth, while providing a mechanism for fluidic sequestration and/or temporally-mediated diffusible signaling between cell populations. Modeling of the M$\mu$n system predicted the ability to isolate diffusible signals, namely ATP. Empirical diffusion studies verified computational modeling. In addition, cell viability, dendrite interaction with the nanoarray, and cellular purinergic response to heat shock were experimentally evaluated within the device for both osteocytes and motor neurons. Our results describe a novel in vitro system in which dendrite-expressing cell types can be studied within nano-environments that mimic in vivo conditions. In particular, the M$\mu$n system enables real-time observation of cell to cell communication between cell populations in distinct, but fluidically coupled regions.},

abstract="In this work, a nanowire-based sensor is designed and its applications toward ethanol sensing is reported. Here, Zinc oxide has been taken as the suitable material for designing nanowire because of its ease of enhanced molecular adsorption while interacting with the target gas molecules. The resonant frequency shift after attaching the ethanol gas molecule is analyzed mathematically and compared with the COMSOL simulation results. The Simulation results showed that the theoretical model leads to a small percentage error of less than 3 {\%}. Hence, this sensor can be used to detect the ethanol molecule in human breath and it provides painless breath diagnosis for alcoholic patients.",
