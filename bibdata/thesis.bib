abstract="We investigate the Einstein relation $\sigma$ = $\beta$D between the diffusion constant D and the ``mobility'', of a ``test particle'' interacting with its environment: $\beta$−1 is the temperature of the system where D is measured and $\sigma$E is the drift in a constant external field E. The relation is found to be satisfied for all model systems in which we can find a unique stationary non-equilibrium State of the environment, as seen from the test particle in the presence of the field. For some systems, e.g. infinite systems of hard rods in one dimension, we find non unique stationary states which do not satisfy the Einstein relation. For some models in a periodic box the Einstein relation is the most direct way of obtaining D . A precise macroscopic formulation of the Einstein relation which makes it mathematically very plausible is given.",

abstract="Dilute electrolyte solutions will be regarded as those which fall into the concentration range where the classical Debye-H{\"u}ckel model of electrolyte solutions is valid. This model regards ions in an electrolyte as being hard spheres separated by a dielectric continuum whose relative permittivity, e, is that of the pure solvent. In water this model is valid up to 0.001 mol dm -3 for 1: 1 electrolytes.",
