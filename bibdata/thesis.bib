abstract="We investigate the Einstein relation $\sigma$ = $\beta$D between the diffusion constant D and the ``mobility'', of a ``test particle'' interacting with its environment: $\beta$−1 is the temperature of the system where D is measured and $\sigma$E is the drift in a constant external field E. The relation is found to be satisfied for all model systems in which we can find a unique stationary non-equilibrium State of the environment, as seen from the test particle in the presence of the field. For some systems, e.g. infinite systems of hard rods in one dimension, we find non unique stationary states which do not satisfy the Einstein relation. For some models in a periodic box the Einstein relation is the most direct way of obtaining D . A precise macroscopic formulation of the Einstein relation which makes it mathematically very plausible is given.",

abstract="We provide a brief introduction to applications of ordinary differential equation (ODE) rate equations in chemistry, biology and physics. In mechanics, Newton's laws prescribe how to write the rate equations while in other fields, the ODEs are based on different principles. In the context of chemical reactions, the law of mass action yields systems of first-order ODEs in terms of the reactants and products. For population dynamics and epidemic models, similar considerations yield comparable nonlinear ODEs. We review geometric and analytic considerations based on local properties for single first-order autonomous equations (phase line dynamics) and extend them to the qualitative understanding of global behaviour in two-dimensional phase plane systems.",

abstract = "Motor proteins are able to move protein filaments in vitro. However, useful work cannot be extracted from the existing in vitro systems because filament motions are in random directions on two-dimensional surfaces. We succeeded in restricting kinesin-driven movements of microtubules along linear tracks by using micrometer-scaled grooves lithographically fabricated on glass surfaces. We also accomplished the extraction of unidirectional movement from the bidirectional movements along the linear tracks by adding arrowhead patterns on the tracks. These “rectifiers” enabled us to construct microminiturized circulators in which populations of microtubules rotated in one direction, and to actively transport microtubules between two pools connected by arrowheaded tracks in the fields of micrometer scales."

abstract="``Electrode potential'' is certainly the most used term in electrochemistry, and is very likely to be one of the most popular in the entire field of chemistry. Sound knowledge of the physical and chemical phenomena involved in the establishment of electrode potentials does not correspond, however, to the very wide use of the term. None would be surprised by a 0.059-V change in potential of a hydrogen electrode as the activity of H+ in solution is changed by a power of ten, but it would certainly be surprising if everyone knowing this were actually able to give a physical description of what is occurring at the electrode as the concentration of H+ is changed and why the electrode potential changes. Further, when the term ``electrode potential'' is used, it generally refers to the potential as experimentally measured with respect to a given reference electrode. Conceptually, however, no reference electrode must necessarily be involved for an ``electrode potential'' to be defined. It follows that the physical meaning behind the same term ``electrode potential'' is quite different in the two cases. This is certainly not as well recognized as the term itself is.",
